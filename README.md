## User Story

```
AS A manager

I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info

SO THAT I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Business Context

When establishing a strong development team, it is important to have up-to-date information about members. Rather than navigating to each team member's contact information in scattered locations, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles and contact information in HTML format.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN the user has a prospective team to gather

WHEN prompted for the number and type of team members and their contact information

THEN an HTML webpage is generated displays summaries for each person
```
